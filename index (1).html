                        Hey, I'm Olayemi Adaramola ‚Äî the friend who actually enjoys untangling tech mishaps (and headphone wires). Whether someone needs help resetting a phone or figuring out a digital mystery, I'm always ready to jump in and break things down step by step. My journey began in wireless customer service, where I developed strong listening skills, quick thinking, and a knack for staying calm under pressure even when the answer is "Did you try turning it off and on again?"

                    <p class="intro-text">
                        Now, I spend my time digging into digital forensics, exploring AI and web development, and building simple tools to make life easier. I believe every gadget, app, or spreadsheet has a story to tell and I love helping people figure out what's really going on under the hood.
