            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey, I’m OLayemi Adaramola — the friend who actually enjoys untangling tech mishaps (and headphone wires). Whether someone needs help resetting a phone or figuring out a digital mystery, I’m always ready to jump in and break things down step by step. My journey began in wireless customer service, where I developed strong listening skills, quick thinking, and a knack for staying calm under pressure—even when the answer is “Did you try turning it off and on again?”
Now, I spend my time digging into digital forensics, exploring AI and web development, and building simple tools to make life easier. I believe every gadget, app, or spreadsheet has a story to tell—and I love helping people figure out what’s really going on under the hood.
How can I help you?
I’m happy to troubleshoot tech issues, explain confusing error messages, or walk through solutions—without jargon or judgment.preply+1
If you’re curious about AI or want to learn web development basics, I can mentor, share tips, and help you get started on your own projects.4cornerresources+1
Need to streamline a process or build a useful spreadsheet? I love designing little tools and guides tailored to real, everyday problems.zippia+1
For digital forensics questions—like recovering lost data or investigating digital hiccups—I can guide the process, explain findings, and suggest practical next steps.michellecederberg+1
When I’m not behind a screen, you’ll find me at the gym, experimenting with smoothie recipes, or sharing music recs and memes. I believe learning should be fun, tech should be for everyone, and there’s always room for another playlist.
If you’re looking for support with a tech challenge, want to swap stories, or have an idea worth building, let’s connect! I’m always up for collaboration, clear communication, and finding solutions together
